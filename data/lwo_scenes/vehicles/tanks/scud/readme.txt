Save Time With Viewpoint Datasets(tm)
Modeling or digitizing the 3D objects you want to place within your
animation or real-time scenario is time consuming. That's where
Viewpoint comes in. Go ahead, experiment with the sample Datasets
provided here. Discover why many of the top animation and special-effects
houses rely on accurate, modifiable Viewpoint data.

Why re-invent 3D object data that has already been created? Especially
when it can be yours right away. Viewpoint has hundreds of precision
ready-to-use Datasets available for use with over fifty different 3D
software packages, with more Datasets being added daily. We also can
create custom Datasets to your specifications. Use Viewpoint on your next
3D project and find out how we can simplify your life. 

In the Format You Need
Viewpoint Datasets(tm) can be imported into and manipulated with dozens
of 3D software applications that run across a variety of hardware
platforms. Over fifty major 3D applications and all platforms are
supported by Viewpoint, allowing you to work in the computing
environment that you are most comfortable with. 

Available Now - DATASHOP (tm) CD ROM
With fast overnight Dataset delivery, you can be animating tomorrow. Get
Viewpoint's DataShop(tm) CD ROM, available for select software
applications, and instant access to the data you need is only a phone call
away. And you can reuse Datasets again and again. One Dataset can be used
for several projects. The only restriction is that the data not be resold or
redistributed in original or modified form.
