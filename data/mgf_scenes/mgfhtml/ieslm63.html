<A NAME=begin>Relation to IESNA LM-63 and Luminaire Catalogs</A>
</H2>
Recently, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America
(IESNA) adopted MGF as the <A HREF=notes.html#2>official standard</A>
for representing luminaire geometry and materials.
The way this works in an IES luminaire data file is through the
addition of a keyword called LUMINOUSGEOMETRY, which is given on a
line in the header portion of a file (before the TILT specification)
like so:
<P>
<B>[LUMINOUSGEOMETRY]</B>
<I>mgf_file</I>
<P>
The given MGF file must exist relative to the directory containing
the IES file (i.e. the same stipulations and restrictions on pathnames
apply as for the MGF
<A HREF=i.html>i</A>
entity).
Furthermore, the position of the MGF geometry must be
such that the gross geometric specification of emitting surfaces
in the IES file completely
blocks or encloses the luminous portions of the MGF description.
Specifically, any ray traced towards the MGF geometry must strike
the IES gross geometry before it strikes any luminous surface in the
MGF description.
This provides a convenient way of preventing overcounting in the
illumination calculation, while still allowing for accurate fixture
appearance.
<P>
To give two examples, let us consider first a recessed can, followed
by a hanging direct/indirect fluorescent fixture.
<P>
The most appropriate IES geometric specification for the emitting
area of a can light would be a circular disk.
Since the IES gross geometry gives only the diameter of the disk, the
actual 3-dimensional placement is implicitly defined as having a
center at the origin, with the radiating disk facing in the
negative Z direction (nadir, downwards).
The MGF geometry would then be placed such that any luminous portion
was above this disk, and no portion of it would obstruct the IES
geometry.
The most sensible position therefore has the IES disk flush with the
MGF can opening, as shown in Figure 3.
<P>

<P>
In the case of a direct/indirect fluorescent fixture, light will
exit both the top and the bottom sides, and the IES geometry must
enclose the radiating portion of the fixture entirely.
It is acceptable to have additional MGF geometry above the 
fixture so long as it does not radiate, which is what we must do if
we wish to include the support rods, as shown in Figure 4.
<P>
<IMG SRC=fig4.gif>
<P>
Note that the origin is always in the exact center of the IES
geometry.
<P>
Not all fixtures will fit the simple IES geometry specification so
nicely.
For odd-shaped fixtures, it may be necessary to use an IES geometry
that does not match the radiating area terribly well in order that
it completely block or enclose the required MGF specification.
<P>
The unit of length in the MGF file is always meters, regardless of
the units specified in the enclosing IES file.
However, any and all multipliers applied to the candlepower data in the
IES file will also be applied to the emittance of surfaces in the
MGF specification, so that one MGF file may serve similar
luminaires that differ in their total output.
