NAME
</H4>
f - create an N-sided polygonal face
<P>
<H4>
SYNOPSIS
</H4>
<B>f</B>
<I>v1 v2 ... vN</I>
<P>
<H4>
DESCRIPTION
</H4>
Create a polygonal face made of the current material
by connecting the named vertices in order, and connecting the last
vertex to the first.
There must be at least three vertices, and if any vertex is undefined,
an error will result.
<P>
The surface orientation is determined by the right-hand rule; when
the curl of the fingers follows the given order of the vertices, the
surface normal points in the thumb direction.
Face vertices should be coplanar, though this is difficult to guarantee
in a 3-dimensional specification.
<P>
If any vertices have associated surface normals, they will be used
instead of the average plane normal, though it is safest to specify
either all normals or no normals, and to stick with triangles
when normals are used.
Also, specified normals should point in the general direction of the
surface for best results.

There is no explicit representation of holes in MGF.  A hole must be
represented implicitly by connecting vertices to form "seams."  For
example, a wall with a window in it might look as shown in Figure 1.
In many systems, the wall itself would be represented with the first
list of vertices, (v1,v2,v3,v4) and the hole associated with that
wall as a second set of vertices (v5,v6,v7,v8).  In MGF, we must
give the whole thing as a single polygon, connecting the vertices so
as to create a "seam," as shown in Figure 2.
This could be written in MGF as "f v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 v5 v4".

<P>
It is very important that the order of the hole be opposite to the
order of the outer perimeter, otherwise the polygon will be
"twisted" on top of itself.  Note also that the seam was traversed
in both directions, once going from v4 to v5, and again returning
from v5 to v4.  This is a necessary condition for a proper seam.
<P>
The choice of vertices to make into a seam is somewhat arbitrary, but
some rendering systems may not give sane results if you cross over a
hole with part of your seam.  If we had chosen to create the seam
between v2 and v5 in the above example instead of v4 and v5, the seam
would cross our hole and <A HREF=notes.html#4>may not render correctly</A>.
