This model was created as part of a lighting design study conducted by
Jennifer Veitch and Guy Newsham of the NRC.  The actual lighting designs
were done by Don Ayotte of Wood, Banani and Associates in Kanata, Ontario.

With the exception of a few furniture items, this model was created
entirely by hand in MGF using a text editor, and is an excellent place
to discover just what this language can do.

The following files are the ones you will need to work with.  The others
are included from these main files, and may be ignored for the most part.

	material.mgf	- materials file (used by room.mgf and furn.mgf)
	room.mgf	- basic room geometry
	furn.mgf	- room partitions and furniture
	design1.mgf	- lighting design #1
	design2.mgf	- lighting design #2
	design3.mgf	- lighting design #3
	design4.mgf	- lighting design #4
	design5.mgf	- lighting design #5
	design6.mgf	- lighting design #6
	design7.mgf	- lighting design #7
	design8.mgf	- lighting design #8
	design9.mgf	- lighting design #9

To create just the room with no lighting and no furniture, use:

	material.mgf room.mgf

To create an empty room with the lights from the first design, use:

	material.mgf room.mgf design1.mgf

I'll warn you, however, that this will have a dozen desk lamps floating
in midair where the desks should have been.

To create a furnished room with the fourth lighting design, use:

	material.mgf room.mgf furn.mgf design4.mgf
