Hi!!

This is my conversion of Freightliner Aerodyne truck model that i download FREE from internet.
I spend some time to add some details to this model. I hope you like it.

here is what was changed:

-new wheels (all tires and rims)
-add Freightliner logos on front and sides of engine cover
-new mapping and texture of the body (side art is not seen on the picture, file Graphic1.jpg) 
-scale ( i hope it scaled to the original size if not please let me know ).

any comment to this model please mail to my adress...  Bansheewoj@interia.pl

i`m still working on some trailers for that model.

sorry for my English, i know it`s not very good, but i`m learning. bye, bye,.
