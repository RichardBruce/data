	US Naval Cruiser (U.S.S. Generic) lower deck

This model was created by Saba Rofchaei and Greg Ward under contract
from the U.S. Navy.  It is an H-shaped deck space with three lighting
configurations.  The files used for each are:

	materials.mgf shipfull.mgf	- Ship under full lighting
	materials.mgf shipemer.mgf	- Ship under emergency lighting
	materials.mgf shipbatl.mgf	- Ship under "battle" lanterns

This is an extremely complex model, and contains hundreds of thousands
of surfaces once all the include files have been expanded.  We don't
recommend using this model on small memory machines!
