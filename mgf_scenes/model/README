This directory contains MGF input files for a conference room and
five possible lighting systems.  The data originated from the WWW
site:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/compare.html

The above site also contains numerous renderings and measurements
(captured images) of this space, and a parser for the MGF scene
format.  This data is provided for comparison, validation and
experimentation with different lighting simulation and rendering
packages, and comes without warranty or recommendation.

The files in this directory are named below:

	README		This file
	basic.mgf	The basic conference room model, sans lighting
	df.mgf		The direct fluorescent lighting system
	dfl.mgf		MGF file referenced in df.mgf
	dif.mgf		The direct/indirect fluorescent lighting system
	difl.mgf	MGF file referenced in dif.mgf
	dl.mgf		The downlights
	dl0.mgf		Downlights, switched off
	dll.ies		IES file referenced in dl.mgf
	f0.mgf		Fluorescent fixtures, switched off
	if.mgf		The indirect fluorescent lighting system
	ifl.mgf		MGF file referenced in if.mgf
	materials.mgf	The materials required by all
	ww.mgf		The wall-washers
	ww0.mgf		Wall-washers, switched off
	wwl.ies		IES file referenced in ww.mgf
